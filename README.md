# ScreenStream
Screen Stream over HTTP - an Android mobile app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.dvkr.screenstream

The application allows viewing the device screen in your web browser.
The main idea is to show your device screen during presentations and demos.
No need of any additional software except for this app and a web browser.
It uses MJPEG to encode screen images and send them through network socket. So it works with any desktop or mobile browser which supports MJPEG (Chrome, Safari, EDGE, Firefox).

The program works only via WiFi connection, so your device has to be connected to WiFi. No Internet required, however, there must be a network connection between the client and the device.
The number of client connections is unlimited, but be aware that each of them requires some CPU resources to send data.

It uses Android Cast feature and requires at least Android 5.0 to operate.

If there are any issues or ideas feel free to contact me.
